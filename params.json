{"name":"Semantic contours","body":"###Semantic Contours from Inverse Detectors \r\n\r\nThis is an evolving piece of code that implements the techniques in this paper:\r\n\r\nBharath Hariharan, Pablo Arbelaez, Lubomir Bourdev, Subhransu Maji, Jitendra Malik.**Semantic Contoursfrom Inverse Detectors**. In _International Conference on Computer Vision, 2011_.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the repo contains code for bootstrapping an inverse detector out of a HOG detector(in the folder _inverse detector_) and code for using the inverse detector to reweight contours (in the folder _reweight_). The file demo.m is a readable demo that explains how to run the code.\r\n\r\nThe code for reweighting can also be used for other things, such as for reweighting pixel values based on segmentation masks associated with detections etc.\r\n\r\nPlease contact bharath2 [AT] cs [DOT] berkeley [DOT] edu in case you have questions.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Code for the ICCV 2011 paper\"Semantic contours from inverse detectors\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
